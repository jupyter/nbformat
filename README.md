## Installation

From the command line:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
pip install nbformat
```

## Python Version Support

This library supported python 2.7 and python 3.5+ for `4.x.x` releases. With python 2's end-of-life nbformat `5.x.x` is now python 3.5+ only. Support for 3.5 will be dropped when it's officially sunset by the python organization.

## Contributing
